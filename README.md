# HorizonHotelsWebsite
How does it work?
--
-The database can be created using either CreateDatabase.py or you can use the database dump provided.

-Create an account with email ____@admin.com and any valid password to make an admin account, e.g. account with email: admin@admin.com password: admin.

-To access admin functionality simply log-in with admin account, to exit admin functionality simply log-out.

-Admin accounts can delete users, delete user bookings, view queries and finally edit hotels.

-The website is designed to calculate the price based on specific features of a booking such as the length of stay, location and whether the booking is in peak or off-peak season, etc. For example a booking made 45 days in advanced gets a 5% discount.

-The hotels all have their own capacities of standard, double and family rooms which is updated upon bookings being made/deleted.

-Users must be logged in to access most of the website such as the booking features.

-A cancellation fee is also calculated when a user cancels a booking based on the number of days until the booking would've taken place.

-If having any trouble with required packages please refer to requirements.txt
